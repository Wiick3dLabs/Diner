##Build confidence as a developer by building something of your own.
1. Manage yourself (your time and your emotions) when given a large amount of unstructured work.
2. Gain experience building a complex client-side application that consumes an API.
3. Document your work and share it with the public in an effective and articulate manner.
4. Learn new technologies by reading documentation and experimenting.
